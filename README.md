# Digit-recognition
In this project, we have used a SVM model to predict the handwritten english digits from 0-9.
  
We have used MNIST database which contains 60000 training images and 10000 test images. It contains 28*28 number of features. We have loaded the dataset from the oython library named datasets.  
  
But the dataset is available on the internet in kaggle. Link :  https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv  
  
  
Requirements:  
  
   We have to install necessary libraries using pip command which are namely keras,tensorflow,numpy,sklearn and execute he code in jupyter notebook.
  
Anoher requirment is GitBash (If you want to download the repository to run the code)  
  
  
File Descriptions:  
  
  
Digit Recognition.ipynb - This file loads the data, preprocesses the image into Non linear Model readable image. The SVM layer model has  2 layers - RGF AND POLY. The input is taken as an image and output is given as a label from (0-9). It can also predict a handwritten image drawn in Paint and give output as a label.  
  
  
  
Steps of Execution:

		$ git clone https://github.com/AditiDey/Digit-recognition.git
OR  
  
  1.Download the file and place it in a same folder.  
  2.Open jupyter notebook and run the code.

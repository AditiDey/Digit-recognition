# Digit-recognition
In this project, we have used a SVM model to predict the handwritten english digits from 0-9.
  
We have used MNIST database which contains 60000 training images and 10000 test images. It contains 28*28 number of features. We have loaded the dataset from the oython library named datasets.  
  
But the dataset is available on the internet in kaggle. Link :  https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv  
  
  
Requirements:  
  
  Mentioned in the requirements.txt  
  
Anoher requirment is GitBash (If you want to download the repository to run the code)  
  
  
File Descriptions:  
  
  
Digit Recognition.ipynb - This file loads the data, preprocesses the image into Non linear Model readable image. The SVM layer model has  2 layers - RGF AND POLY. The input is taken as an image and output is given as a label from (0-9). It can also predict a handwritten image drawn in Paint and give output as a label.  
  
  The webapp is made with Gradio, which is an open source python library which lets us create customizable UI components. 
  
Steps of Execution:

		$ git clone https://github.com/AditiDey/Digit-recognition.git
OR  
  
  1.Download the file and place it in a same folder.  
  2.Open jupyter notebook and run the code.
